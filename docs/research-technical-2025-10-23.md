---

## 9. Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

### ADR-001: Technology Stack for Telegram Bot MVP

**Status:** ✅ Recommended

**Date:** 2025-10-23

---

#### Context

We need to build a Telegram bot that monitors communication in 15 partner chats, analyzing questions and answers using AI, and sending daily reports. The project has specific constraints:

- Developer: Beginner Python skill level
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks for MVP
- Budget: < $50/month
- Scale: 15 chats initially, potential growth to 50-100
- Requirements: Daily scheduled reports, AI analysis, CI/CD automation

---

#### Decision Drivers

1. **Time to Market** (Critical) - Need MVP in 1-2 weeks
2. **Learning Curve** (Critical) - Beginner-friendly with excellent documentation
3. **Cost** (High) - Stay under $50/month budget
4. **Operational Simplicity** (High) - Minimal infrastructure management
5. **Scalability** (Medium) - Handle growth to 50-100 chats
6. **Production Readiness** (High) - Battle-tested components

---

#### Considered Options

**Option A: Recommended Stack**
- Bot: python-telegram-bot v20+
- Scheduler: APScheduler
- Database: SQLite
- Hosting: Render
- Cost: $0-7/month

**Option B: Scalable Stack**
- Bot: aiogram v3
- Scheduler: Celery + Redis
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Hosting: Railway
- Cost: $15-20/month

---

#### Decision

**We recommend Option A: Recommended Stack**

**Bot Framework:** python-telegram-bot v20+
**Task Scheduler:** APScheduler 3.11+
**Database:** SQLite 3
**AI/LLM:** Anthropic Claude API (Message Batches)
**Hosting:** Render (Free → Hobby tier)
**CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
**Container:** Docker

---

#### Rationale

1. **python-telegram-bot over aiogram:**
   - Superior documentation for beginners
   - Larger English-speaking community
   - 25k+ GitHub stars vs 217k weekly downloads
   - More production case studies available
   - Trade-off: Manual FSM vs built-in (acceptable for MVP)

2. **APScheduler over Celery:**
   - Zero external dependencies (no Redis/RabbitMQ)
   - Perfect for single-process scheduled tasks
   - 5-minute setup vs 1-2 days for Celery
   - Sufficient for 15-50 chats
   - Trade-off: Not distributed (acceptable for MVP scale)

3. **SQLite over PostgreSQL:**
   - Zero configuration required
   - Built into Python
   - Perfect for 15-50 chats with low write volume
   - Easy migration path to Postgres later
   - Trade-off: Single-writer limitation (not an issue for daily batch writes)

4. **Render over Railway/Fly.io/VPS:**
   - Free tier available
   - Built-in background worker support (critical for scheduled tasks)
   - 5-minute deployment
   - Upgrade path clear ($7/mo Hobby tier)
   - Trade-off: Free tier sleeps after 15min (solved by Hobby tier)

5. **GitHub Actions (unanimous choice):**
   - Free for public repos, 2000 min/month private
   - Native GitHub integration
   - Excellent Docker support
   - Deploy to all hosting options

---

#### Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Fastest time to MVP (5-7 days realistic)
- ✅ Lowest learning curve for beginner
- ✅ Minimal operational overhead
- ✅ Cost-effective ($0-7/month)
- ✅ All components open source
- ✅ Clear migration paths for scaling

**Negative:**
- ⚠️ APScheduler has multi-worker gotchas (mitigated: single-process deployment)
- ⚠️ SQLite write concurrency limitations (acceptable: batch writes once daily)
- ⚠️ Not designed for 1000+ chats (acceptable: not the requirement)
- ⚠️ Render free tier sleeps (mitigated: $7/mo Hobby tier)

**Neutral:**
- Manual FSM implementation needed (vs built-in aiogram FSM)
- Migration effort if outgrow stack (estimated 2-3 days to Celery/Postgres)

---

#### Implementation Notes

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Deploy as single Docker container (avoid APScheduler multi-worker issues)
2. Use SQLAlchemy ORM (enables easy Postgres migration)
3. Implement Repository pattern (abstract database access)
4. Start with Render free tier, upgrade to Hobby for production
5. Use Claude API Message Batches (50% cost savings)

**Testing Strategy:**
1. Days 1-2: POC to validate approach
2. Unit tests for business logic
3. Integration tests with test Telegram group
4. Monitor costs closely in first week

**Monitoring:**
1. Health check endpoint for scheduler
2. Claude API cost tracking
3. Error alerts to admin
4. Daily report delivery confirmation
