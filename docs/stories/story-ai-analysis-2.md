## Technical Details

**Components to Implement:**
- `ClaudeAPIService` - Claude API batch processing
- `MessageAnalyzerService` - Analysis orchestration
- `ReportGeneratorService` - Report formatting
- `ReportRepository` - Report persistence
- Database schema (Report entity)

**Claude API Prompt Structure:**
```
Analyze the following Telegram messages and identify:
1. Questions (with category: technical/business/other)
2. Answers (mapped to question message_id)
3. Response times
4. Unanswered questions

Messages:
[List of messages with timestamp, user, text]

Return JSON format:
{
  "questions": [...],
  "answers": [...],
  "summary": {...}
}
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    chat_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    report_date DATE NOT NULL,
    questions_count INTEGER,
    answered_count INTEGER,
    unanswered_count INTEGER,
    avg_response_time_minutes REAL,
    report_content TEXT,
    sent_at DATETIME,
    INDEX idx_chat_date (chat_id, report_date DESC),
    FOREIGN KEY (chat_id) REFERENCES chats(id)
);
```

**Dependencies:**
- anthropic==0.18.0
- pydantic==2.5.0 (for response validation)

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Test report formatting logic
- Test response time calculation
- Test JSON parsing from Claude API
- Test Markdown generation

**Integration Tests:**
- Test full analysis flow with mocked Claude API
- Test with real Claude API (small batch, test account)
- Test report generation with 20 known questions dataset
- Test edge cases (0 questions, all unanswered, etc.)

**Test Datasets:**
- 20 known questions (validate >90% detection)
- 10 known Q→A pairs (validate >85% mapping)
- Messages at specific time intervals (validate categorization)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (coverage ≥80%)
- [ ] Integration tests passing with real Claude API
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Cost tracking verified (<$30/month projection)
- [ ] Sample report generated and validated

## Cost Estimation

**Claude API Costs (Message Batches - 50% discount):**
- Input: $1.50 per million tokens (discounted)
- Output: $7.50 per million tokens (discounted)
- Estimated: ~200 messages/chat/day × 15 chats = 3,000 messages
- Token estimate: ~500K tokens/day input, ~100K output
- **Monthly cost: ~$20-30**

## Notes

- This is the core AI functionality story
- Prompt engineering is critical - iterate during POC
- Monitor costs closely in first 2 weeks
- Consider caching analysis results to reduce API calls

### Debug Log

**Implementation Plan (2025-10-24):**
1. Setup dependencies (anthropic, pydantic)
2. Create Report model and database schema
3. Implement Claude API service with message analysis
4. Build Message Analyzer orchestration service
5. Create Report Generator with Markdown formatting
6. Write comprehensive unit tests
7. Verify integration with existing components

- Used pydantic>=2.10.0 instead of 2.5.0 for Python 3.14 compatibility
- Implemented standard Claude API first, marked Message Batches API as TODO for 50% cost savings
- Created comprehensive Claude API prompt for question detection, categorization, and answer mapping
- Implemented response time categorization: <1h (Fast), 1-4h (Medium), 4-24h (Slow), >24h (Very Slow)
- Added Markdown escaping for special characters in report generation
- Top reactions section added as placeholder (requires reaction tracking implementation)

**Test Results:**
- 51 tests passing (30 new + 21 existing)
- 64% code coverage
