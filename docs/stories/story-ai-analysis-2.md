```sql
CREATE TABLE reports (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    chat_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    report_date DATE NOT NULL,
    questions_count INTEGER,
    answered_count INTEGER,
    unanswered_count INTEGER,
    avg_response_time_minutes REAL,
    report_content TEXT,
    sent_at DATETIME,
    INDEX idx_chat_date (chat_id, report_date DESC),
    FOREIGN KEY (chat_id) REFERENCES chats(id)
);
```

**Dependencies:**
- anthropic==0.18.0
- pydantic==2.5.0 (for response validation)

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Test report formatting logic
- Test response time calculation

## Cost Estimation

**Claude API Costs (Message Batches - 50% discount):**
- Input: $1.50 per million tokens (discounted)
- Output: $7.50 per million tokens (discounted)
- Estimated: ~200 messages/chat/day × 15 chats = 3,000 messages
- Token estimate: ~500K tokens/day input, ~100K output
- **Monthly cost: ~$20-30**

## Notes

- This is the core AI functionality story
- Prompt engineering is critical - iterate during POC
- Monitor costs closely in first 2 weeks
- Consider caching analysis results to reduce API calls

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Vladimir
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Outcome:** Changes Requested

### Summary

Story IMF-MVP-2 implements AI-powered message analysis and report generation using Claude API. The core functionality is well-implemented with solid architecture (Repository pattern, Service layer separation) and good test coverage (66%). However, there are critical issues that need to be addressed before production deployment:

1. **Critical**: Async/await inconsistency in analyze_messages (line 69, 115)
2. **High**: Incomplete Message Batches API implementation (50% cost savings not realized)
3. **High**: Low test coverage for critical services (MessageAnalyzerService: 30%, ReportDeliveryService: 46%)
4. **Medium**: Security - API key not validated on service init
5. **Medium**: Missing admin notification implementation

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

**[H-1] Async/Await Inconsistency in MessageAnalyzerService**
- Location: `src/services/message_analyzer_service.py:69, 115`
- Issue: `analyze_chat_last_24h()` and `analyze_custom_period()` are async but call sync `claude_service.analyze_messages()` without await
- Impact: Will cause runtime errors or incorrect async behavior
- Fix: Either make `ClaudeAPIService.analyze_messages()` async or use `asyncio.to_thread()` for sync call
- AC Impact: Affects AC-002, AC-003

**[H-2] Message Batches API Not Implemented**
- Location: `src/services/claude_api_service.py:240-259`
- Issue: `analyze_messages_batch()` returns sync result instead of implementing batch API
- Impact: Missing 50% cost savings ($10-15/month), critical for budget constraint (<$30/month)
- Evidence: Line 258 TODO comment, tech spec requires batch processing
- Fix: Implement Anthropic Message Batches API with polling logic
- AC Impact: Affects cost projections

**[H-3] Low Test Coverage for Critical Services**
- Location: `src/services/message_analyzer_service.py` (30% coverage), `src/services/report_delivery_service.py` (46%)
- Issue: Core orchestration logic undertested
- Impact: High risk of bugs in production, violates ≥80% coverage requirement
- Fix: Add unit tests for MessageAnalyzerService orchestration, ReportDeliveryService delivery logic
- AC Impact: Affects AC-001 through AC-006

#### Medium Severity

**[M-1] API Key Not Validated on Service Initialization**
- Location: `src/services/claude_api_service.py:77-84`
- Issue: `__init__()` doesn't validate API key presence, fails late at runtime (line 178)
- Impact: Poor error handling, delayed failure detection
- Fix: Add validation in `__init__()`: `if not settings.anthropic_api_key: raise ValueError(...)`
- Best Practice: Fail-fast principle

**[M-2] Missing Admin Notification Implementation**
- Location: `src/services/report_delivery_service.py:156`
- Issue: TODO comment for admin notification when >50% chats fail
- Impact: Violates AC-010 (Error Handling - admin notification requirement)
- Fix: Implement Telegram notification to admin user when failure threshold exceeded
- AC Impact: AC-010 incomplete

**[M-3] Response Time Categorization Mismatch**
- Location: Tech spec says 1-2h for Medium, but implementation uses 1-4h
- Files: `src/services/report_generator_service.py:41`, `tests/integration/test_claude_api_accuracy.py:258`
- Issue: Spec (line 574 tech-spec) says 1-2h Medium, 2-24h Slow; implementation has 1-4h Medium, 4-24h Slow
- Impact: Reports don't match documented categories
- Fix: Align implementation with tech spec or update tech spec
- AC Impact: AC-004

#### Low Severity

**[L-1] Markdown Code Block Handling Edge Case**
- Location: `src/services/claude_api_service.py:214-219`
- Issue: Regex extraction for markdown blocks uses `.*` which is non-greedy in DOTALL mode
- Impact: Could fail on nested JSON or malformed responses
- Fix: Use `json_match = re.search(r'```(?:json)?\s*(\{[\s\S]*\})\s*```', ...)`
- Best Practice: More robust JSON extraction

**[L-2] Missing Type Hints in Test Fixtures**
- Location: `tests/integration/test_claude_api_accuracy.py`
- Issue: Test helper methods lack return type hints
- Impact: Reduced code clarity, harder to catch type errors
- Fix: Add type hints to `_categorize_response_time()` and test helper functions

**[L-3] Hardcoded Model Name**
- Location: `src/services/claude_api_service.py:72`
- Issue: MODEL constant hardcoded instead of configurable
- Impact: Can't easily switch models or test with different versions
- Fix: Move to Settings or make configurable via env var
- Best Practice: Configuration over constants

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC ID | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| AC-001: Claude API Integration | ⚠️ Partial | Authentication works, but batch processing not implemented. Standard API works. |
| AC-002: Question Detection | ✅ Pass | Test validates >90% accuracy (line 50-141 test_claude_api_accuracy.py). Real API tested successfully. |
| AC-003: Answer Mapping | ✅ Pass | Test validates >85% accuracy (line 143-252 test_claude_api_accuracy.py). Response time calculation correct. |
| AC-004: Response Time Categorization | ⚠️ Partial | Logic implemented but categories don't match tech spec. Test passes with implementation's categories. |
| AC-005: Report Generation | ✅ Pass | All required sections present (header, summary, response times, unanswered, reactions placeholder). Markdown formatting correct. |
| AC-006: Data Persistence | ✅ Pass | Report entity, repository CRUD complete. Historical queries working (line 95-113 report_repository.py). |

**Summary:** 3 fully passing, 3 partially passing. Core functionality works but needs refinement.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Overall Coverage:** 66% (859 statements, 296 missed)

**Strong Coverage:**
- ✅ ReportGeneratorService: 95% (line 179-182 only uncovered)
- ✅ ReportRepository: 100%
- ✅ ChatRepository: 100%
- ✅ CleanupService: 100%
- ✅ HealthCheck: 100%

**Weak Coverage:**
- ❌ MessageAnalyzerService: 30% (lines 36-39, 53-76, 94-125 uncovered)
- ❌ TelegramBotService: 33% (lines 33-34, 42-52, 66-73, 82, 95-102, 110-125, 133-143)
- ❌ ReportDeliveryService: 46% (lines 76-164, 178-220, 338-343, 362-395)
- ⚠️ ClaudeAPIService: 82% (lines 179, 183, 216-219, 232-238, 259 uncovered - mostly error handling)

**Critical Gaps:**
1. No integration tests for MessageAnalyzerService orchestration
2. No tests for ReportDeliveryService error handling and rate limiting
3. Main application (main.py) not tested at all (0% coverage)

**Recommendation:** Add integration tests for MessageAnalyzerService and ReportDeliveryService before production deployment.

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Strengths:**
1. **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction (MessageRepository, ChatRepository, ReportRepository)
2. **Service Layer Separation**: Business logic isolated from infrastructure (ClaudeAPIService, MessageAnalyzerService, ReportGeneratorService)
3. **Pydantic Validation**: Strong typing for Claude API responses (QuestionAnalysis, AnswerAnalysis, AnalysisSummary)
4. **Database Schema**: Well-designed Report entity with proper indexes (idx_chat_date)
5. **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks in Claude API service with detailed logging

**⚠️ Concerns:**
1. **Async/Sync Mixing**: MessageAnalyzerService is async but calls sync ClaudeAPIService - inconsistent pattern
2. **Batch API Missing**: Architecture assumes batch processing (per tech spec) but implementation uses standard API
3. **No Retry Logic**: ClaudeAPIService lacks retry logic for transient failures (tech spec requires retry with exponential backoff)

**🔧 Alignment with Tech Spec:**
- ✅ Technology stack matches (Python 3.14, SQLAlchemy, Anthropic SDK, Pydantic)
- ✅ Data models match spec (Report entity schema line 131-163 tech-spec)
- ⚠️ Missing batch processing (line 188-206 tech-spec requires Message Batches API)
- ⚠️ Response time categories don't match spec

### Security Notes

**✅ Good Practices:**
1. API key loaded from environment variables (not hardcoded)
2. Pydantic validation prevents injection attacks on Claude API responses
3. Markdown escaping in report generation (line 211 report_generator_service.py)

**⚠️ Concerns:**
1. **API Key Validation**: No validation on service init - fails late (line 178-179 claude_api_service.py)
2. **No Rate Limiting**: ClaudeAPIService doesn't implement rate limiting (tech spec: Tier 1 limits 50 req/min)
3. **Logging Sensitive Data**: Response text logged in debug mode (line 210 claude_api_service.py) - could leak message content

**Recommendations:**
1. Add API key validation in `__init__()`
2. Implement rate limiting with exponential backoff
3. Sanitize debug logs to avoid logging user message content

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected:**
- Python 3.14 with asyncio
- SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (modern typed API)
- Anthropic Claude SDK 0.71.0
- Pydantic 2.10+ for validation
- pytest with async support

**Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ Repository pattern for data access

**Verdict:** **Changes Requested**

**Rationale:**
Story IMF-MVP-2 demonstrates solid architecture and well-implemented core functionality. The AI analysis pipeline works correctly (validated by integration tests), report generation is complete, and database schema is well-designed. However, critical issues prevent production deployment:

1. Async/await bug will cause runtime failures
2. Test coverage below requirements (66% vs ≥80% target)
3. Message Batches API not implemented (budget risk)
4. Admin notification missing (AC-010 incomplete)

**Recommendation:** Address H-1, H-2, H-3, M-1, M-2 action items before marking story complete. Estimated effort: 1-2 days.

**Positive Highlights:**
